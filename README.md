- 👋 Hi, I’m Kostya!
- 🕵️‍♂️ I'm a full-time researcher, working on next generation solar cells.
- 👀 I'm constantly on the lookout for new ways of improving my research process. These days it has been Bayesian Optimization. 
- 🌱 My most recent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/adts.202301013) explored the benefits that BO brings in the development of tandem solar cells.
